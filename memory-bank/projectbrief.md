# Project Brief: AI Integration Tools

## Overview

This project consists of three focused AI integration tools designed to connect different services with AI capabilities:

1. **slack-ai-bot**: A dedicated Slack bot with AI integration using Groq LLM
2. **gmail-ai-bot**: A dedicated Gmail bot with AI integration
3. **drive-ai-bot**: A dedicated Google Drive bot with AI integration

## Project Goals

- Provide AI-powered interfaces for different communication platforms
- Enable natural language interactions with AI through familiar interfaces
- Create modular and maintainable code for each integration
- Support independent development and deployment of each tool
- Implement comprehensive testing with real APIs
- Ensure robust error handling and logging

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate directories for each tool:

```bash
/Users/autonomos_dev/Projects/tools/
├── slack-ai-bot/       # Dedicated Slack bot with AI
├── gmail-ai-bot/       # Dedicated Gmail bot with AI
└── drive-ai-bot/       # Dedicated Google Drive bot with AI
```

## Recent Changes

- Continued development of gmail-ai-bot with advanced features
- Enhanced drive-ai-bot with file organization capabilities
- Implemented comprehensive caching mechanism
- Improved error handling and logging across tools
- Maintained focus on real API testing and modular design

## Testing Approach

- Always use real APIs for testing, never use mocks
- Create comprehensive integration tests with real API interactions
- Develop end-to-end test scenarios that validate actual service behavior
- Ensure all tests run against actual services for accurate validation
- Implement thorough error handling and edge case testing

## Future Directions

- Expand AI capabilities across all tools
- Improve performance and scalability
- Enhance machine learning-based filtering and categorization
- Develop more sophisticated matching algorithms
- Implement distributed caching
